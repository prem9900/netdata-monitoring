 Monitor System Resources Using Netdata

 Objective
To set up Netdata on an AWS EC2 server using Docker and monitor system performance metrics like CPU, RAM, disk I/O, and Docker containers in real time.



  ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- Netdata  â€“ Lightweight monitoring tool
-  Docker â€“ To run Netdata easily
-  AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2)  â€“ Cloud server for hosting
-  Web Browser  â€“ For viewing the Netdata dashboard



 ðŸš€ What I Did (Step-by-Step)

1.  Connected to AWS EC2 instance using SSH.
2.  Installed Docker** on the server.
3. Pulled and ran the Netdata Docker container using this command:

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name=netdata \
     -p 19999:19999 \
     --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
     --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
     netdata/netdata

4. Opened port 19999** in the EC2 security group to allow external access.

5. Accessed the Netdata dashboard via browser at:

   ```
   http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:19999
   ```

6. Monitored:

     CPU usage
     RAM utilization
     Disk activity
     Docker container stats

7. Took a screenshot of the live dashboard and saved it in the `screenshot/` folder.


   Screenshot

Below is the Netdata dashboard running on the EC2 server:

It shows live metrics like CPU usage, RAM, disk activity, and Docker container stats.



It shows live metrics like CPU usage, RAM, disk activity, and Docker container stats.


 âœ… Outcome

 Successfully set up Netdata on an AWS EC2 server.
 Gained hands-on experience in using Docker to deploy monitoring tools.
 Understood how to track live performance data on servers and containers.
